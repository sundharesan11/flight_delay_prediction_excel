# flight_delay_prediction_excel
Flight delay prediction using the naive bayes algorithm with excel methods. This is a part of assignment of my probability and statistics study group.
I have implemented the same on the python. Link to python notebook project: (https://github.com/sundharesan11/FlightDelayPrediction_NaiveBayes)
